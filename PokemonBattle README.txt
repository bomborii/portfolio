This project is a 2D video game involving characters from Pokemon. The player moves their character with the arrow keys or WASD 
keys and attempts to destroy the enemy with attacks while defending itself with a shield. 1, 2, or 3 on the number pad starts the
game on the respective difficulty level. This project was my final programming project in high school, and I look back on it fondly.
Unfortunately, I lost the source code and can only present the executable. This program was written in C# on Visual Studio.
